# Callbacks

This is the code for the callbacks section of the advent post.

[callback.p6](callback.p6) just contains the code presented in the post.

A more elaborate example consists of [pretty.p6](pretty.p6), which will use the
[Expat.pm6](Expat.pm6) module to pretty-print the [ugly.xml](ugly.xml) file.

If you have [libexpat](http://expat.sourceforge.net/) installed, you can just
run these samples directly, no additional C code necessary.
